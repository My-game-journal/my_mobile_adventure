# Mobile Controls Button Verification Report

## Button Names and Paths Verification ✅

All button names in `mobile_controls.tscn` are correctly assigned and match the node paths used in `mobile_controls.gd`.

### Scene Structure (from .tscn)
```
MobileControls (CanvasLayer)
├── LeftControls (Control)
│   ├── MoveLeftButton (Button) - Text: "◀"
│   └── MoveRightButton (Button) - Text: "▶"
├── RightControls (Control)
│   ├── JumpButton (Button) - Text: "JUMP"
│   ├── RollButton (Button) - Text: "ROLL"
│   └── ShieldButton (Button) - Text: "BLOCK"
├── AttackControls (Control)
│   └── AttackButton (Button) - Text: "ATTACK"
└── PauseButton (Button) - Text: "PAUSE"
```

### Node Path References (in mobile_controls.gd) ✅
```gdscript
$LeftControls/MoveLeftButton      ✓ Correct
$LeftControls/MoveRightButton     ✓ Correct
$RightControls/JumpButton         ✓ Correct
$RightControls/RollButton         ✓ Correct
$RightControls/ShieldButton       ✓ Correct
$AttackControls/AttackButton      ✓ Correct
$PauseButton                      ✓ Correct
```

### Signal Connections ✅
All signals emitted by `mobile_controls.gd` match exactly with the signals connected in `player.gd`:

| Signal Name | mobile_controls.gd | player.gd | Status |
|-------------|-------------------|-----------|---------|
| `move_left_pressed` | ✓ Emitted | ✓ Connected | ✅ Match |
| `move_left_released` | ✓ Emitted | ✓ Connected | ✅ Match |
| `move_right_pressed` | ✓ Emitted | ✓ Connected | ✅ Match |
| `move_right_released` | ✓ Emitted | ✓ Connected | ✅ Match |
| `jump_pressed` | ✓ Emitted | ✓ Connected | ✅ Match |
| `roll_pressed` | ✓ Emitted | ✓ Connected | ✅ Match |
| `shield_pressed` | ✓ Emitted | ✓ Connected | ✅ Match |
| `shield_released` | ✓ Emitted | ✓ Connected | ✅ Match |
| `attack_pressed` | ✓ Emitted | ✓ Connected | ✅ Match |
| `pause_pressed` | ✓ Emitted | ✓ Connected | ✅ Match |

### Button Event Connections ✅
```gdscript
# Movement buttons (press/release tracking)
MoveLeftButton.button_down → _on_move_left_pressed()
MoveLeftButton.button_up → _on_move_left_released()
MoveRightButton.button_down → _on_move_right_pressed()
MoveRightButton.button_up → _on_move_right_released()

# Shield button (press/release tracking)
ShieldButton.button_down → _on_shield_pressed()
ShieldButton.button_up → _on_shield_released()

# Action buttons (single press)
JumpButton.pressed → _on_jump_pressed()
RollButton.pressed → _on_roll_pressed()
AttackButton.pressed → _on_attack_pressed()
PauseButton.pressed → _on_pause_pressed()
```

### Mouse Interaction Support ✅
All buttons have proper mouse interaction setup:
- `mouse_filter = Control.MOUSE_FILTER_PASS`
- Hover effects with `mouse_entered`/`mouse_exited`
- Visual feedback with `modulate` color changes

## Conclusion ✅

**All button names are correctly assigned and properly connected!**

The mobile controls system is properly configured with:
1. ✅ Correct node names in .tscn file
2. ✅ Matching node paths in mobile_controls.gd
3. ✅ Proper signal definitions and emissions
4. ✅ Correct signal connections in player.gd
5. ✅ Appropriate event handlers for each button type
6. ✅ Mouse interaction support for testing

If there are any issues with mobile controls, they would likely be related to:
- Scene instantiation/loading
- Signal connection timing
- Input event handling
- Button state management

But the button names and references are all correct.
