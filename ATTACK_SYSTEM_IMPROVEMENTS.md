# Attack Combo System Improvements

## Problems Fixed

### 1. **Stuck Flipping Issue**
- **Problem**: Player could flip horizontally during attacks but couldn't move, creating inconsistent behavior
- **Solution**: 
  - Prevented direction updates during attacks in `handle_movement()`
  - Disabled sprite flipping during attack state in `update_animation()`
  - Attack direction is now set once at the start of each attack

### 2. **Movement Lockout**
- **Problem**: Complete movement stop (`velocity.x = 0`) during attacks felt unnatural
- **Solution**: 
  - Replaced instant stop with gradual deceleration (`velocity.x * 0.8`)
  - Allows for more natural momentum preservation
  - Player doesn't feel "glued" to the ground during attacks

### 3. **Attack State Stuck**
- **Problem**: Player could get permanently stuck in attack state if animation failed
- **Solution**: 
  - Added `attack_stuck_timer` as safety mechanism
  - 2-second timeout automatically forces exit from attack state
  - Clears all attack-related variables on timeout

### 4. **Inconsistent Attack Direction**
- **Problem**: Attack direction could change mid-combo causing visual inconsistencies
- **Solution**: 
  - Attack direction is determined at the start of each attack
  - Uses current input if available, otherwise maintains last direction
  - Sprite flip is set once per attack and locked during animation

## Technical Implementation

### New Variables
```gdscript
# Attack safety variables
var attack_stuck_timer: Timer
var attack_stuck_timeout := 2.0  # Maximum time to stay in attack state
```

### Enhanced Movement Logic
```gdscript
PlayerState.ATTACKING:
    # Reduced movement during attacks - not completely locked
    velocity.x = velocity.x * 0.8  # Gradual deceleration instead of instant stop
```

### Smart Direction Handling
```gdscript
# Update last_direction for flipping, but be more careful during attacks
if direction != 0:
    if state != PlayerState.ATTACKING:
        # Only update direction when not attacking to prevent stuck flipping
        last_direction = direction
```

### Attack Direction Lock
```gdscript
# Set attack direction based on current input or maintain last direction
var keyboard_direction = Input.get_axis("move_left_button", "move_right_button")
var current_input_direction = keyboard_direction + mobile_direction
current_input_direction = clamp(current_input_direction, -1.0, 1.0)

# Update attack direction: use input direction if available, otherwise keep last direction
if current_input_direction != 0:
    last_direction = current_input_direction

# Set the flip direction for this attack
$AnimatedSprite2D.flip_h = last_direction < 0
```

### Safety Mechanisms
```gdscript
func _on_attack_stuck_timeout():
    # Safety mechanism: force exit from attack state if stuck too long
    if state == PlayerState.ATTACKING:
        state = PlayerState.IDLE
        can_combo = false
        current_combo_index = 0
        velocity.x = 0  # Clear any residual velocity
```

## Improvements Made

1. **Consistent Visual Feedback**: Attack direction is locked for the duration of each attack
2. **Natural Movement Feel**: Gradual deceleration instead of instant stopping
3. **Robust State Management**: Multiple safety mechanisms prevent getting stuck
4. **Better Input Handling**: Input is processed intelligently based on current state
5. **Fail-Safe Recovery**: Automatic recovery from stuck states after timeout

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Basic Combo**: Test W → W → W (keyboard) and A1 → A1 → A1 (mobile)
2. **Direction Changes**: Try changing direction mid-combo to ensure no flipping issues
3. **Movement During Attack**: Verify gradual deceleration feels natural
4. **Edge Cases**: Test rapid button pressing, holding directions during attacks
5. **Recovery**: Verify system recovers properly if animations glitch

The attack system now provides consistent, responsive combat while preventing the stuck states and visual inconsistencies.
