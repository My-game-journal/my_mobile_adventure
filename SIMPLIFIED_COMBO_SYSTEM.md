# Simplified Attack Combo System

## ✅ **New Approach - Frame-Based Combo Windows**

I've completely redesigned the combo system to be much simpler and more reliable:

### **🔧 How It Now Works:**

1. **Combo Window System**: Instead of queueing attacks, the system opens "combo windows" during specific frames of each attack animation
2. **Direct Transition**: When you press attack during a combo window, it immediately starts the next attack
3. **Frame-Based Timing**: Each attack enables combo input during its middle/end frames

### **📅 New Variables:**
- `can_combo: bool` - Whether combo input is currently accepted
- Removed `queued_attack` - No more attack queueing

### **⚡ Frame Timing:**
- **attack_0**: Combo window opens at frame 3+
- **attack_1**: Combo window opens at frame 4+  
- **attack_2**: Combo window opens at frame 4+

### **🎮 User Experience:**
1. Press W (or A1 button) → attack_0 starts
2. Press W again during attack_0 (after frame 3) → attack_1 starts immediately
3. Press W again during attack_1 (after frame 4) → attack_2 starts immediately
4. Wait 0.8 seconds without input → combo resets to attack_0

### **🎯 Benefits:**
- **More Responsive**: No delay between combo inputs
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear timing based on animation frames
- **Simpler Logic**: No complex queueing system
- **More Reliable**: Direct state transitions

### **🧪 Testing:**
1. **Single Attack**: Press W once → should see attack_0 and return to idle
2. **Quick Combo**: Press W rapidly 3 times → should see attack_0 → attack_1 → attack_2
3. **Timed Combo**: Press W, wait for mid-animation, press W again → should chain properly
4. **Reset Test**: Do 1 attack, wait 1 second, press W → should start from attack_0 again

### **🔍 Debug Removed:**
- All console print statements removed
- Clean, production-ready code
- Focus on functionality over debugging

The combo system should now feel much more responsive and work reliably with both keyboard (W) and mobile UI (A1 button) inputs!
