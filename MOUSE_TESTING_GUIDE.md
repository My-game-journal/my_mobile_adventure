## Testing Tips:
1. **Single Input**: Test each button individually first
2. **Combined Input**: Try using keyboard + mouse together
3. **Hold vs Click**: Test both quick clicks and hold-downs
4. **Rapid Input**: Test button mashing for responsiveness
5. **Edge Cases**: Try clicking multiple buttons simultaneously

This setup allows you to fully test your mobile game's UI using mouse input on your laptop!
