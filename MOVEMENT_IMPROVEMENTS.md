# Player Movement Improvements

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Input Handling
- **Before**: Restrictive state checks prevented simultaneous actions
- **After**: More flexible state conditions allow movement during jumping and rolling
- **Key Changes**:
  - `can_jump`: Allowed during movement states (IDLE, RUNNING, ROLLING)
  - `can_roll`: Allowed during most ground-based states
  - Rolling can now be initiated while jumping (if on ground)
  - Jumping preserves rolling state when possible

### 2. Improved Movement System
- **Before**: Rolling locked movement to `last_direction * ROLL_SPEED`
- **After**: Directional control maintained during rolling
- **Features**:
  - **Directional Rolling**: Player can steer while rolling
  - **Momentum Preservation**: Maintains 70% speed when no input during roll
  - **Speed Boost**: Rolling with directional input uses full `ROLL_SPEED`
  - **Air Control**: Jumping while moving maintains horizontal velocity

### 3. Smart State Transitions
- **Rolling End Behavior**:
  - If in air → Transition to `JUMPING`
  - If moving → Transition to `RUNNING` 
  - If idle → Transition to `IDLE`
- **Animation Updates**:
  - Proper air animation handling
  - Smooth transitions between movement states
  - Maintains roll animation even in air

### 4. Enhanced Animation System
- **Air Animations**: 
  - Prioritizes jumping animation
  - Allows roll animation to continue in air
  - Falls back to jump animation as default
- **Ground Transitions**:
  - Automatically switches from jumping to running when moving
  - Transitions from running/jumping to idle when stopping

## New Capabilities

1. **Move + Jump**: Hold left/right while pressing jump - maintains horizontal momentum
2. **Move + Roll**: Hold left/right while pressing roll - steers during roll
3. **Roll + Jump**: Start rolling, then jump - continues roll motion in air
4. **Directional Rolling**: Change direction mid-roll for better control

## Input Combinations Now Possible

- `Left + Jump`: Jump while moving left
- `Right + Roll`: Roll to the right with full speed
- `Left + Roll + Jump`: Roll left, then jump while maintaining roll momentum
- `Roll (no direction)`: Roll using last movement direction at 70% speed
- `Direction change during roll`: Steer the roll in real-time

## Technical Implementation

```gdscript
# Flexible state conditions
var can_jump = state not in [PlayerState.ATTACKING, PlayerState.SHIELDING]
var can_roll = state not in [PlayerState.ATTACKING, PlayerState.SHIELDING, PlayerState.JUMPING]

# Enhanced rolling movement
PlayerState.ROLLING:
    if direction != 0:
        velocity.x = direction * ROLL_SPEED        # Full control
    else:
        velocity.x = last_direction * ROLL_SPEED * 0.7  # Momentum
```

The movement system now feels much more responsive and allows for complex movement combinations that enhance gameplay fluidity.
